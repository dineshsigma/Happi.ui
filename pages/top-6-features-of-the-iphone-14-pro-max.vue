                  The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>release of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Max, and 14 series pro</strong></span> has opened up a whole new world for Apple users. Many people were confused by the different names but still
                  took the plunge and bought one of these phones. Max is for ‘maximize’ your iPhone experience with smaller storage, whereas 14 series pro is for ‘x’ marking the spot where you can find hidden gems in your camera app. If you’re someone
                  who likes to keep track of every new feature that gets added to your phone, this article is for you. As we get closer to 2020, there are more and more features being added to our smartphones on a regular basis. From functions like facial
                  recognition and gesture control to AI assistants and even things like waterproofing. Here’s a list of the top 6 features of the <strong>Apple iphone 14 pro</strong><br /><strong><br />  Face ID</strong><br />  The most obvious new feature
                  is the inclusion of Face ID, which will replace Touch ID on all three models. Apple has confirmed that the new facial recognition system will be faster and more secure than its predecessor, with a couple of key improvements. <br /><br
                  />1.Proved accuracy – Face ID works by projecting a grid of 30,000 invisible infrared dots over your face. This grid is then read by the iPhone’s TrueDepth camera system, and the data is sent through Apple’s advanced security algorithms
                  to generate a mathematical representation of your face. The iPhone 14 Pro Max will then scan your face each time you want to unlock the phone. It scans in 3D so it can work even in the dark. The system will also be able to recognize
                  facial changes due to ageing or weight loss. <br />2.No more fingerprints – Apple hasn’t said exactly how the mathematical representation of your face is stored on the phone, but it’s likely that it’s converted into a code. This means
                  that someone would need to hack into Apple’s servers to get your face code and then reverse engineer it to find out what it looks like.<br /> <br /><strong>  Wireless Charging</strong><br />  Another big change is the ability of the
                  Max to charge wirelessly. This will work with a number of charging pads available on the market, but the official Apple option is the AirPower charging pad. Some of the other great features of the charging pad include analytics and a
                  special surface that will charge your phone faster than a standard charging pad. The Max is not the first Iphone to have wireless charging capabilities. The 14 series pro, Xs, and Xs Max have all had this feature since their release.<br
                  /><br /> <strong> Gesture Control</strong><br />  The iPhone 14 Pro Max has added a feature called ‘Swipe’ that uses advanced machine learning to recognize gestures you make while using your phone. It will be able to recognize things
                  like swiping between apps, dragging content from one app to another and even swiping your thumb to take a screenshot. The swipe can be customized for one-handed operation, so you can move content to either side of the screen. Swipe will
                  be available for all three models, but only the Pro Max and 14 series pro will be able to customize it.<br /><br /> <strong> Waterproofing</strong><br />  Most people will remember that the iPhone 7 was the first Apple smartphone to
                  be waterproof and dustproof with an IP67 rating. The 8, 8 Plus, X, and Xs all kept this rating, but the 14 series pro and Max were removed from the list of IP-rated devices. The good news is that the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been given
                  the same IP68 rating as the iPhone 14 series pro, so you don’t need to worry about using your phone in the rain or dropping it in the water. This rating means that the phone should be able to withstand submersion in liquid up to 5 feet
                  for up to 30 minutes.<br /><br /> <strong> AI Assistant with Siri</strong><br />  Siri has been the go-to AI assistant for Apple users for years now, but the new Max and 14 series pro will give users more capabilities than ever before
                  thanks to the new A13 Bionic chip. This chip has been developed alongside the new Neural Engine, which allows the chip’s AI capabilities to process 50 times faster than before. This means that Siri will be able to access more data and
                  learn new things, which in turn will make it a more useful tool. You will also be able to use Siri to speak to people on your phone whenever you need to. You can also type out your messages using voice-to-text technology.<br /><br /> <strong>Face detection while taking photos</strong><br
                  />  The <strong>iPhone 14 Pro Max</strong> has a new feature that will allow you to take a photo while looking at the camera. This means that you will not have to tap the shutter button to take a picture, and you will not have to wait
                  for the camera app to focus on your subject first. The Max will recognize your face and automatically take a photo. The camera will also shoot burst shots when you use the volume up button as a shutter button. This is great for capturing
                  candid moments such as sporting events or parties, as it will take multiple images in quick succession so there is a higher chance of getting a good shot.<br /><br />  <strong>Animojis and AR capabilities</strong><br />  The<strong> iPhone 14 Pro Max</strong>                  features an improved TrueDepth camera that allows you to use Animojis even better. These are special emojis that use your voice and facial expressions to bring them to life. The camera can now follow your movements, so you can use a
                  wide range of different expressions and have them appear in real time on the screen. The new model has also been updated with a wider camera lens, so you can fit more people into the shot and take advantage of the new AR capabilities.<br
                  /><br />  <strong>New colours for the iPhone</strong><br />  Finally, rumours suggest that we may see a new colour being added to the iPhones. The Max was launched in black, silver, and gold, but a white model was added for the 14 series
                  pro. There is no official confirmation about this, but it would make sense for Apple to add a new colour to keep the iPhone fresh. It would also help with the confusion of which model is which. The new <strong>iPhone 14 Pro Max</strong>                  brings a lot of new features to the table, but it also keeps some of the features from the previous models up to par. There is a lot for users to get excited about and it is likely that Apple will keep adding to the list of new features
                  with each new model. These are just a few of the many new features that the Max brings. It’s helpful to know what the other new features are so you can decide which model is best for you. If you have an iPhone 14 Pro Max, keep an eye
                  out for new features and keep track of the new features that are added over time.<br /><br /><strong>  Conclusion</strong><br />  The Iphone 14 Pro Max is definitely a great device to have. While it doesn’t bring anything new to the
                  table in terms of design, it does bring a whole lot of new features that were previously only available to Android users. If you’re looking to upgrade your phone, now is a better time than ever to do so. If you’re someone who uses their
                  phone daily to make calls, send or receive messages, or listen to music, the <strong>Iphone 14 Pro Max</strong> is definitely the phone for you.
