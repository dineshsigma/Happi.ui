It’s the one device that is with you constantly, from waking up in the morning to going to bed at night. The way you feel and the things you do throughout the day are all influenced by having a phone. It’s almost that time again, when you need to buy presents for people you care about. If you have someone special in your life who is also a tech geek and owns an Android, then you can find some good ideas for them on this list. But how do you know if they want a new phone as a gift? That’s not always something that people will outright tell you. However, there are usually subtle clues that help tip us off as to what kind of gift they would prefer — like looking around their house or car for old CD cases and movie ticket stubs (because most people don’t keep their CD collection on their phone).

                         is the best what is the intended use of the phone? Will they be doing lots of gaming, watching videos, listening to music, or taking photos and videos? Also, how important is the camera quality? Is the person in a low-data or roaming area often and will they benefit from a phone with a great network connection? What about the size of the phone? Bigger phones are great for watching videos and other media content, but smaller phones are easier to carry around. What kind of storage does the phone have? 8GB is usually not enough for most people unless it is an extremely basic model.

<div class="ans-gap"></div>
<a href="https://www.happimobiles.com/mobiles/vivo">Vivo mobile phones</a>
 sellers say that buying a phone as a gift can be tricky. You want to make sure that you’re buying the right model and capacity. You don’t want to buy too much phone or too little phone. 

<ul class="listing">
  <li>It’s best to buy unlocked phones as gifts because the person will be able to switch out SIM cards with ease. This is especially important when buying a phone for someone who travels a lot.

</li>
  <li>It’s also a good idea to buy phones with a warranty when you can. This can help with any glitches that may occur with the device or the OS — especially with new models.

</li>
  <li>If the person is on a network right now, then you might want to consider buying the same network for the gift. That way, they aren’t jumping networks and having to change out a SIM card.
 
</li>
  <li>If you are gifting a family member, be sure to ask them which phones they’ve been eyeing. You want to buy a gift that they’ll truly appreciate and enjoy.
</li>
</ul>
                        <br /><br /><strong>Don’t buy the newest phone as a gift

</strong>
                      <div class="ans-gap"></div>

The newest phone is not always the best gift. Some people will want the new model simply for bragging rights.
 While that is okay for some folks, for others it’s a waste of money. You also have to remember that sometimes 
 the newest model has flaws or bugs that are worked out in the next model. If you buy someone the latest and greatest,
  they may be disappointed when they have issues that are quickly resolved by an update in the next model. 
  If they are buying the phone themselves, they may be more grateful for an earlier model. 
  They may even be able to save some cash by buying a refurbished phone or an unlocked model. 
  This will also save you money and allow you to get a better phone for your budget.
<br>
                        <br /><br /><strong>Don’t buy an Android phone as a gift unless you know their current device well.

</strong>
                        <div class="ans-gap"></div>

You need to know the make and model of the phone they have right now, as well as the operating system.
 This is essential in finding the right gift. What if they have an old phone with the OS that they are 
 still deeply embedded in? Don’t go buying them a brand new phone that they can’t switch to without a lot of trouble.
  For example, a <b>Vivo mobile phones</b> owner will not want to shift to an iphone mobile phone. 
If they have an older device that they love, check to see if it can be updated to the latest OS.
 If it can, then you might be able to buy a gift that will help them with their current phone. 
 If it can’t, then don’t spend money on a phone you know they won’t be able to use.

<br>  <br /><strong>Don’t buy any phone based on looks alone.


</strong>
                        <div class="ans-gap"></div>

The design of a phone can be very subjective. Some people may love the way a phone looks, while others hate it.
 Always remember that looks aren’t everything — functionality trumps form every time. If you go based on looks,
  then you may end up with a phone that the person doesn’t want. For example, if you go by popularity,
   you may end up with the latest Samsung Galaxy model. While the phone is a great Android device, it is not for everyone.
 It’s a big phone with a huge screen that may or may not fit comfortably in someone’s hand.
<br> 
 <br />
 <strong>Don’t buy refurbished phones as gifts.



</strong>
                        <div class="ans-gap"></div>
When buying gifts, you always want to go with something brand new. While refurbished phones are a great way to save some cash,
 they still have some issues that you don’t want to deal with. They may have been repaired incorrectly, and they may break down 
 faster than normal. Buying a refurbished phone is like buying a car that has been wrecked once already. 
 You don’t know what issues it has and what repairs have been done to repair the phone.
 You’ll have to deal with those issues sooner or later, and you might regret the gift you gave.
 <br> 
 <br />
 <strong>Bottom line: The best Android phone as a gift is one that you’ve tested with your own eyes.



</strong>
                        <div class="ans-gap"></div>
Test the phone with your own data before you buy it. 
You don’t want to give someone a gift only to have them have to return it because it doesn’t work properly. 
You may even want to buy the phone through your own account and let them pay you back — that way, 
there are no issues with returning it. If you’re shopping for someone who is very specific about their phone,
 then you can get something like a <b>Samsung Galaxy S10e</b> from Verizon. It’s the best Android phone for the money 
 and perfect for people who want a <a href="https://developer.android.com/">great Android device</a> but don’t want to spend a ton of money. 
 It’s an amazing gift for people who are hard to buy.
